## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Adapted the DESCRIPTION such that the description does not start with "This package".

* Added single quotations around package names in title and description.

* Removed "| LICENSE" in the description and the license file.

* Please add small executable examples in leafdown Rd-file. 


## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R version 4.0.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
