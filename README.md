## Features

-   Adds drilldown functionality for [leaflet
    choropleths](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/choropleths.html)
    maps.
-   Allows the selection of regions/shapes.
-   Easy to use and well-integrated into syntax of the
    [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) R package.
-   Allows communication of the map with other shiny elements
    (e.g.Â graphs).
-   Computationally efficient as drilldown is only executed for selected
    regions of interest.
